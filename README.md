Storypod 

There are many untold stories on African continent. This project aims to make it easy to tell and share stories about history, culture, language and other interesting things in audio versions.

Creators will be able to record and share their stories and users will be able to discover interesting stories and follow their favorite creators.

This platform will serve as an entertainment, as well as a way to conserve for stories that were not written down.


How did I come up with this project?

My great grandmother died in 2010 at the age of 87. We did conserve her photos but not her stories and ideas. I wish I had conserved her stories so my kids could listen to them. 

In the last decade we have seen an explosion of photo sharing apps, we deserve a way to conserve and share ideas/stories with our loved ones and the public in a format that is easy for everyone, even people who canâ€™t read and write like my great grandmother.
