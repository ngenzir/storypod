# storypod
 
 
Many old people have stories to tell to their grandkids and their great grand kids etc.. about the life they lived, how things were back then when they were young, and other interesting things but nowadays kids don't get enough time to spend with their grandparents so those stories go untold. This project aims to make it easy to tell and share those stories to conserve history, culture, language and other interesting things in audio version.
 
Creators will be able to record and share their stories with a close group or with the public and users will be able to discover interesting stories and follow their favorite creators.
 
This platform will serve as an entertainment, as well as a way to conserve for stories that were not written down, local languages, and culture.
 
 
# How did I come up with this project?
 
My great grandmother died at the age of 87. She told me many interesting stories of the past a few times I visited her a year. 
We did conserve her photos but not her stories and ideas. I wish I had conserved her stories so my kids could listen to them. 
 
In the last decade we have seen an explosion of photo sharing apps, we deserve a way to conserve and share ideas/stories with our loved ones and the public in a format that is easy for everyone.
